# Declare and Multiple Integer values with sll: Assembly program to demonstrate how to declare a
# integer values, and multiply them with sll
	# sll ==> 'shift left logical' shifts bits to the left (multiplication)
	# srl ==> 'shift right logical' shifts bits to the right (division)

	addi $s0, $zero, 4
	# SLL will multiply the contents by 2^i
	# In this case 2^2 (4)
	# 2 represents the exponent
	sll $t0, $s0, 2
	# Multiplies by 2 (2^1)
	sll $t0, $s0, 1
