# Declare and add Integer Values: Assembly program to demonstrate how to declare and add two integer
# values. 
	# .word is used to store the integer value 
	# lw is used to load the values into a register
	# add command is used to add to registers and save them into a temp register ($t2)
	
.data
	# Integer values are stored as words (32-bit data stores)
	numberA: .word 5
	numberB: .word 10
.text
	# Load the numberA into register $t0
	lw $t0, numberA($zero)
	# Load the numberB into register $t1
	lw $t1, numberB($zero)
	
	# $t2 will get the value of $t0 + $t1
	add $t2, $t0, $t1
	
	# Notify the system to prepare to print a .word
	li $v0, 1
	add $a0, $zero, $t2
