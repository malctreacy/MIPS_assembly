# Declare and Print Float Values: Assembly program to demonstrate how to declare an 
# float value.  
	# .float is used to declare the type. 
	# li $v0, 2 is used to notify the system you want to print a float. 
	# lwc1 is "load word co-processor 1" which loads our float into a special register that is capable of handling float values. 

.data
	PI: .float 3.14
.text
	# Orders the system to prepare to print a float (2 = float)
	li $v0, 2 
	# Orders the system to loa dthe value in PI, and put it in $f12
	# lwc1 -- > "load word co-processor 1", code processor 1 processes float values
	lwc1 $f12, PI 
	# Orders the system to print the float value
